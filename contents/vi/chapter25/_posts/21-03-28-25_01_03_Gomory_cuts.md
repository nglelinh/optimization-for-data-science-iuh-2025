Mathematician Gomory devised a method to easily find valid inequalities based on the following fact:
>
if $$a \le b$$ and $$a$$ is an integer then $$a \le \lfloor b \rfloor$$.

That is, if a is an integer, then even if b is rounded down, the relationship that a is less than or equal to b is maintained.

## Gomory fractional cut
Let's say that the feasible set $$S$$ defined by the convex hull of the IP problem mentioned earlier is as follows:

$$ S \subseteq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^{n}_{+} : \sum^{n}_{j=1} a_{j} x_{j} = a_{0} \right\} \quad \text{where} \quad  a_{0} \notin \mathbb{Z}$$

In this case, the Gomory fractional cut is defined as follows:

$$ \sum^{n}_{j=1} (a_{j} - \lfloor a_{j} \rfloor) x_{j} \ge a_{0} -  \lfloor a_{0} \rfloor $$

There are many ideas that extend this concept. For example, there are Chvatal cuts, split cuts, lift-and-project cuts, etc.

The derivation process of Gomory fractional cut is detailed on Wikipedia, so please refer to it.
