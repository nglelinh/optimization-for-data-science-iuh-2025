In this chapter, we will look at one of the 2nd-order methods, the **Barrier Method**.

The **Barrier Method** is a technique for solving **inequality constraint and equality constrained smooth problems**, which are considered the most difficult among 2nd-order method problems.

(For reference, using the gradient to solve an optimization problem is called a 1st-order method, and using the Hessian is called a 2nd-order method.)
