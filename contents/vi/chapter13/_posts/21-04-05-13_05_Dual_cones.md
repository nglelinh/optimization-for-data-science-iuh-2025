## Dual cones
There exists a cone $$K ⊆ \mathbb{R}^n$$.
(Recalling the content covered earlier in [02-06-01]({% multilang_post_url contents/chapter02/21-02-11-02_06_01_Dual_cones %}), this means $$x \in K, t ≥ 0 \to tx \in K$$.)
> $$ K∗ = \{ y : y^Tx ≥ 0 \text{ for all } x \in K \} $$

This is called a **dual cone**, and it is always a convex cone (even when $$K$$ is not convex).

##### [Note]
$$y \in K∗ \iff \text{ the halfspace } \{ x : y^Tx ≥ 0 \} \text { contains } K$$
(From B & V page 52)

An important property here is that if $$K$$ is closed and a convex cone, then $$K^{∗∗} = K$$.

#### Examples:
• The dual cone of a linear subspace $$V$$ is $$V^{⊥}$$, i.e., the orthogonal complement.
E.g., $$(row(A))^{∗} = null(A) $$

• The dual cone of the norm cone $$K = \{ (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n+1 : \| x \|≤ t \}$$ is the norm cone of its dual norm $$K^{∗} = \{ (y,s) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \| y \|_{∗} ≤ s \}$$.

• The positive semidefinite cone $$\mathbb{S}^n_+$$ is a self-dual convex cone, meaning $$(\mathbb{S}^n_+)^{∗} = \mathbb{S}^n_+$$.


Why is this the case? Let's verify:
> $$ Y \succeq 0 \iff tr(Y X) ≥ 0 \text{ for all } X \succeq 0$$

$$X$$'s eigenvalue decomposition

## Dual cones and dual problems
Consider the cone constrained problem:

> $$ \min_x f(x) \text{ subject to } Ax \in K$$

When $$I^{∗}_K(y) = \max_{z\in K} z^Ty$$ is the support function of $$K$$,
the dual problem of the above expression is as follows:
> $$ \max_u −f^∗(A^Tu)−I^∗_K(−u)$$


When $$K$$ is a cone, this can be easily defined as follows:
> $$ \max_u −f^∗(A^Tu) \text{ subject to } u \in K^{∗} $$

Here $$K^{∗}$$ is the dual cone of $$K$$. because $$= I_K^{*}(-u) \ I_{K^{*}}(−u) $$ 

This is quite useful because many different types of constraints can appear as cone constraints.
