In this chapter, we look at Newton's Method.

Newton's method is an approach for finding the minimum of a function with a twice differentiable function using the second-order Taylor expansion. It finds the minimum by approximating the function and iteratively updating the solution. Near the optimum, it achieves quadratic convergence and is much faster than gradient descent.
