In this chapter, we apply Newton's method to the root finding problem. The Newton's method used in optimization problems has some differences, which are explained here. [[Newton's method in optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization)][[Newton's method in root finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)]

## Newton's method for root finding
Suppose we have a vector function $$F:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$$. The root finding problem is to find $$x$$ such that $$F(x) = 0$$.

>$$
>\begin{align}
>F(x) = 0.
>\end{align}
>$$

This problem is solved by choosing an initial value $$x^{(0)}$$ and applying Newton's method iteratively:

>$$
>\begin{align}
>&\text{choose initial }x^{(0)}\in \mathbb{R}^{n},\\\\
>&x^{(k)}=x^{(k-1)}-\nabla F(x^{(k-1)})^{-1}F(x^{(k-1)}), \qquad k=1,2,3,...\\\\
>\end{align}
>$$

Here, $$\nabla F(x^{(k-1)})$$ is the Jacobian matrix of $$F$$ at $$x^{(k-1)}$$. The Newton step $$x^{+}=x-\nabla F(x)^{-1}F(x)$$ can be derived using the linear approximation of $$F$$:

>$$
>\begin{align}
>F(y)\approx F(x) + F^{'}(x)(y-x) = 0\\\\
>y = x^{+}=x-F^{'}(x)^{-1}F(x).
>\end{align}
>$$

## Newton's method for optimization problem
Suppose we apply Newton's method to an optimization problem formulated as:

>$$
>\begin{align}
>\min_{x} F(x)
>\end{align}
>$$

This is equivalent to applying Newton's method to the root finding problem for the gradient $$\nabla{F(x)}=0$$ of the objective function $$F(x)$$.

In summary, unlike the problem of finding the root of a given function's derivative ($$\nabla F=0$$) using Newton's method in optimization problems, the root finding problem requires finding the root of the function value itself ($$F=0$$) using Newton's method. This results in a difference of one order in the derivative term in the update formula for $$x$$ in Newton's method for each problem.

## Root finding example
Consider a function $$F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$ defined as follows:

>$$
>\begin{align}
>F(x)=x^{2}-2
>\end{align}
>$$

Starting with an initial guess of $$x^{(0)}=1$$, we apply pure Newton's method, yielding the following results:

As the iteration count $$k$$ increases, we can see that the value of $$x$$ approaches the root $$\sqrt 2 $$.
