This chapter will examine the Frank-Wolfe algorithm proposed by Marguerite Frank and Philip Wolfe in 1956.

The Frank-Wolfe algorithm is an iterative first-order optimization algorithm for constrained convex optimization, also called the conditional gradient method, reduced gradient method, and convex combination algorithm.

This method was originally proposed by Marguerite Frank and Philip Wolfe in 1956. The Frank-Wolfe algorithm considers a linear approximation of the objective function at each iteration and moves toward the minimizer of this linear function.
