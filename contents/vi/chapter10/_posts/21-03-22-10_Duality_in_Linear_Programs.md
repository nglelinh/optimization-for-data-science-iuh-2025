Starting from this chapter, we will examine duality, which plays a significant role in optimization theory.
From an optimization perspective, duality can be simply described as the concept that a single optimization problem can be viewed from two perspectives: the primal problem and the dual problem.

In this chapter, we specifically explore duality in linear programs.
Rather than directly applying it to general convex problems, we will derive the dual problem from the primal problem by applying it to linear programs, and organize how the relationship between these two problems is established and what properties they have under specific conditions.
