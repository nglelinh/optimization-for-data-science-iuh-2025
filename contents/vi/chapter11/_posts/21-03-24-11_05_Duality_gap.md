If the primal problem has value $$f(x)$$ at $$x$$, and the dual problem has value $$g(u,v)$$ at $$u,v$$, then the difference $$f(x) - g(u,v)$$ is called the duality gap.

Meanwhile, these feasible values always satisfy the following relation
>
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) - f^* \leq f(x) - g(u,v), 
\end{equation}
$$

If the duality gap is $$0$$, then $$x$$ is an optimal solution of the primal problem and $$u,v$$ are optimal for the dual problem.

Also, if the duality gap satisfies $$f(x)-g(u,v) \leq \epsilon$$, it implies $$f(x) -f^* \leq \epsilon$$, so algorithms that solve problems iteratively can use the duality gap as a stopping criterion.
