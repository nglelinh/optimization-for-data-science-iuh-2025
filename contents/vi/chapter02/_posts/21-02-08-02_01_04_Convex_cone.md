A cone is a set that extends infinitely in certain directions, like a beam of light from a source, but is not defined in the opposite direction. To determine if a set is a cone, check if the ray starting from the origin and passing through any point in the set is also contained within the set. (Thus, a cone must include the origin.) Because a cone has boundaries, it cannot be an affine set. Let's define this mathematically.

## Cone

A set $$C$$ is a **cone** (or **nonnegative homogeneous set**) if for any point $$x \in C$$, the ray $$\theta x$$ is also in $$C$$ for $$\theta \ge 0$$:
> $$\theta x \in C$$ with $$x \in C$$, $$\theta \ge 0$$

[Reference] Unlike affine or convex sets, when defining a cone, the starting point of the ray is assumed to be the origin, so only one point is used.

## Convex Cone

A set $$C$$ is a **convex cone** if it is both a cone and convex:
> $$\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 \in C$$ with $$x_1, x_2 \in C$$, $$\theta_1, \theta_2 \ge 0$$

The figure below shows a pie-shaped convex cone. In the figure, $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ are points in the cone, and $$\theta_1$$ and $$\theta_2$$ are non-negative scalars.

## Conic combination

A linear combination of several points where all coefficients are non-negative is called a **conic combination** (or **nonnegative linear combination**):
> A point of the form $$\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \theta_k x_k$$ with $$\theta_i \ge 0, i = 1,  ..., k$$

If every conic combination of points in a set $$C$$ is also in $$C$$, then $$C$$ is a conic set.

## Conic hull

The set of all conic combinations of points in $$C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$ is called the **conic hull** of $$C$$. The conic hull is always the smallest convex cone containing $$C$$:
> $$ \{ \theta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \theta_k x_k \mid x_i \in C, \theta_i \ge 0, i = 1, ..., k \} $$
