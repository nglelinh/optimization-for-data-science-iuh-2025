# Acceleration

Acceleration techniques are used to speed up the convergence of optimization algorithms. In the context of proximal gradient methods, acceleration can significantly improve the rate at which solutions are found.

## Nesterov's acceleration
Nesterov's acceleration is a popular technique that introduces momentum to the update steps, allowing the algorithm to move faster towards the optimum.

## FISTA
FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm) is an accelerated proximal gradient method that achieves a convergence rate of $$O(1/k^2)$$.

## Practical considerations
While acceleration can improve convergence, it may also introduce instability or oscillations in some cases. It is important to monitor the behavior of the algorithm and adjust parameters as needed.
