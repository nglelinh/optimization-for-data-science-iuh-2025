## Lipschitz gradients and strong convexity
In this section, we examine an overview of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) technique. While the augmented Lagrangian method previously did not provide decomposability, ADMM is a method that provides decomposability along with convergence properties.
