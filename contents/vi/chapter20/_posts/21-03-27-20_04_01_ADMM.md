# Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)

The **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)** is a powerful optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of dual decomposition and the method of multipliers. It is particularly effective for solving convex optimization problems that can be decomposed into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

Consider the following problem:
>\begin{equation}
\min_{x,z} f(x) + g(z) \quad \text{subject to} \quad Ax + Bz = c
\end{equation}

As before, we can augment the objective function as follows:
>\begin{equation}
\min_{x,z} f(x) + g(z) + \frac{\rho}{2} \lVert Ax + Bz - c \rVert_2^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad Ax + Bz = c
\end{equation}

where $$\rho > 0$$ is the penalty parameter.

## Augmented Lagrangian

The augmented Lagrangian can be defined as:
>\begin{equation}
L_{\rho} (x,z,u) = f(x) + g(z) + u^T(Ax + Bz - c) + \frac{\rho}{2} \lVert Ax + Bz - c \rVert_2^2
\end{equation}

## ADMM Algorithm

ADMM performs the following iterative steps for $$k=1,2,3,\ldots$$:

> $$
> \begin{alignat}{1}
> x^{(k)} & = \arg\min_x  L_{\rho} (x,z^{(k-1)},u^{(k-1)}) \\
> z^{(k)} & = \arg\min_z  L_{\rho} (x^{(k)},z,u^{(k-1)}) \\
> u^{(k)} & = u^{(k-1)} + \rho (Ax^{(k)} + Bz^{(k)} - c) 
> \end{alignat}
> $$

**Key Point:** It is crucial that $$x^{(k)}$$ obtained from the first step is used in the second step to compute $$z^{(k)}$$. This alternating update structure is essential for convergence.

## Comparison with Method of Multipliers

Note that in the general **Method of Multipliers**, the first two steps are replaced by the following joint minimization:
>\begin{equation}
(x^{(k)}, z^{(k)}) = \arg\min_{x,z} L_{\rho} (x,z,u^{(k-1)})     
\end{equation}

The key advantage of ADMM is that it decomposes this joint minimization into two separate, simpler subproblems that can often be solved more efficiently or even in closed form.
