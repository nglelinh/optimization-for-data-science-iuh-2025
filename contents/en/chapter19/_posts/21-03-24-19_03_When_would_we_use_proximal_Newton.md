To understand the usefulness of the proximal newton method, let's compare the proximal newton method and proximal gradient descent on the following problem. **Problem**: $$\min_x g(x) + h(x)$$ # # Proximal gradient descent vs. proximal newton | **Proximal gradient descent** |**Proximal Newton** | | -------- | -------- | | $$\frac{1}{2} \parallel b - x \parallel_2^2 + h(x)$$ minimization | $$b^T x + x^T A x + h(x)$$ minimization | | Prox operator part closed formwith, definition | Prox operator part closed formwith, definition | iteration | iteration (newton than method )| | Gradient descent convergence speed <br > $$O(1/\epsilon)$$ | Newton's method convergence speed <br > $$O(\log \log 1/\epsilon)$$ | method solution actual very different. therefore, , proximal newton method iteration scaled prox operator(quadratic + $$h$$)to, about, fast inner optimizer when, use exists. $$h$$ separable function when, inner optimizerto, a lot usemethod coordinate is descent.
