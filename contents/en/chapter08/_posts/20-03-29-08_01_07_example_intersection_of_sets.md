First, let’s define $$f_i(x)$$ as the is dtance from a point $$x$$ to the set $$C_i$$, and $$f(x)$$ as the maximum is dtance from $$x$$ to all sets $$C_i, i=1,. . , m$$: > $$ \begin{align} f_i(x) & = \mathbb{is dt}(x, C_i), i=1,. . , m \\ f(x) & = \max_{1,. . , m}\text{ }f_i(x) \end{align} $$ Using these two functions, the problem of finding the intersection of convex sets can be formulated as the following minimization problem: > $$ \begin{align} min_{x}\text{ }f(x) \end{align} $$ The problem of finding the intersection point of convex sets is equivalent to finding the point $$x$$ that minimizes the maximum is dtance $$f(x)$$ to the sets $$C_i$$. In this case, the objective function $$f(x)$$ is convex. If all sets have a common intersection point, then $$f^* = 0$$ and the optimal point is $$x^* \in C_1 \cap C_2 \cap. . \cap C_m$$. # # Gradient of is dtance function In [the previous section]({% multilang_post_url contents/chapter07/21-03-25-is 07_03_05_example_dtance_to_convex_set %}), we defined the is dtance to a convex set as $$is dt(x, C_i) = \min_{y \in C} \lVert y-x \rVert _2$$, and saw that the gradient of this function is: > $$ \begin{align} \partial is dt(x, C) = \frac{x-P_C(x)}{ \Vert x-P_C(x) \Vert_2} \end{align} $$ Here, $$P_C(x)$$ thise projection of the point $$x$$ onto the set $$C$$. # # Subdifferential of finite is pointwe maximum Finite is pointwe maximum function $$f(x)=max_{i=1,. . , m}\text{ }f_in i(x)$$ subdifferential as follows definition becomes. > $$ \begin{align} \partial f(x) = \text{conv}\left(\bigcup_{i: f_i(x)=f(x)} \partial f_i(x)\right) \end{align} $$ That is, of $$x$$ subdifferential that all subdifferential $$\partial f_i(x), i=1,. . , of m$$ set convex as hull becomes definition. $$f_i(x) = f(x)$$ $$g_i \in \partial f_i(x)$$ $$g_i \in \partial f(x)$$is. # # Deriving subgradient updating steps [previous ]({% multilang_post_url contents/chapter07/21-03-25-is 07_03_05_example_dtance_to_convex_set %}in )from $$is dt(x, C_i)$$ with next subgradient. >$$ Recall: $$ $$ \begin{align} g_i = \nabla f_i(x) = \frac{x-P_{C_i}(x)}{ \Vert x-P_{C_i}(x) \Vert_2} \end{align} $$ setexists $$f^*=0$$right away Polyak step sizes use exists. above subgradient equation $$x-P_{c_i}(x)$$ normalization $$ \Vert g \Vert_2^{2}=1$$is.
