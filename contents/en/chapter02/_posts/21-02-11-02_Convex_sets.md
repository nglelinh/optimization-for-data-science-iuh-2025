In this chapter, we will study the concept of convex sets, which form the foundation of convex optimization.

#### Background
Convex optimization refers to techniques for finding maxima or minima by defining problems using convex functions.
Convex sets are closely related to convex functions in two main ways:

* Convex functions are defined over convex sets. The domain and range of a function are defined as convex sets, and the main properties of convex functions are determined by these sets.
* If you can transform an optimization problem into one involving a convex function, it becomes easier to solve. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a problem is defined by a convex function. In such cases, you can check whether the epigraph of the function is a convex set to determine if the function is convex.

#### Content
In this chapter, we will cover the definition and examples of convex sets, their main properties, and operations that preserve convexity.
