In this chapter, we will explore the concepts and definitions centered around convex sets. We introduce three types of sets: the most basic is the affine set, and by imposing additional constraints on the affine set, we define the convex set and the cone.

Interestingly, these sets can be thought of as collections of many lines (line), line segments, or rays. An affine set is formed by gathering many lines, a convex set by gathering many line segments, and a cone by gathering many rays. This perspective makes it easier to understand these concepts. Also, a cone is sometimes called a nonnegative homogeneous set, which refers to the property that it extends only in one direction from the origin, helping to clarify the naming.
