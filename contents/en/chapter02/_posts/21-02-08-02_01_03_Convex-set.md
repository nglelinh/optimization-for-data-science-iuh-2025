Now let's look at the core concept of this chapter: the convex set. Intuitively, a convex set is a set with no "dents" or "holes" inside. To determine if a set is convex, check if the line segment connecting any two points in the set is also contained within the set.

## Convex set

A set $$C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a **convex set** if for any two points $$x_1, x_2 \in C$$, the line segment connecting them is also in $$C$$:
> $$\theta x_1 + (1-\theta)x_2 \in C$$ with $$x_1, x_2 \in C$$, $$0 \le \theta \le 1$$

This means that for any two points in $$C$$, all points on the line segment between them are also in $$C$$.

The figure below shows examples of convex sets. The triangle on the left is convex, but the shape with a cavity on the right is not convex because the line segment between some points leaves the set.

## Convex combination

A linear combination of several points where the coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1 is called a **convex combination**:
> A point of the form $$\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \theta_k x_k$$ with $$\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \cdots + \theta_k = 1, \theta_i \ge  0, i = 1,  ..., k$$

If every convex combination of points in a set $$C$$ is also in $$C$$, then $$C$$ is a convex set.

## Convex hull

The set of all convex combinations of points in $$C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$ is called the **convex hull** of $$C$$, denoted as **conv** $$C$$:
> **conv** $$C = \{ \theta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \theta_k x_k \mid x_i \in C, \theta_i \ge 0, i = 1, ..., k, \theta_1 + \cdots + \theta_k = 1 \}$$

The figure below shows the convex hull for a set of 15 points and a shape with a cavity.
