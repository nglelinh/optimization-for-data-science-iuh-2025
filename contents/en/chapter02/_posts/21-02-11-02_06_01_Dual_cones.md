## Dual cones

A dual cone is defined as a pair with a cone, denoted as $$K$$ for the cone and $$K^*$$ for the dual cone. The dual cone is always convex, regardless of whether $$K$$ is convex. The dual cone is defined as the set of points $$y$$ such that the inner product with any $$x$$ in $$K$$ is nonnegative:

> $$K^* = \{y \mid x^T y \ge 0 \text{ for all } x \in K\}$$

For $$x$$ and $$y$$, the inner product being nonnegative means the angle between the vectors is in the range where $$\cos\theta \ge 0$$, i.e., $$0 \le \theta \le 90$$ and $$270 \le \theta \le 360$$. Thus, the boundary of the dual cone is formed in the direction of the negative normal vector of the supporting hyperplane of the cone. The figure below shows the region where the dual cone is defined. In summary, the region of the dual cone is the set of all directions of the negative normal vectors of supporting hyperplanes of the cone at the origin.

Geometrically, if $$y \in K^*$$, then $$-y$$ is the normal of the supporting hyperplane of $$K$$ at the origin. The next figure shows that on the left, the halfspace with inward normal $$y$$ contains the cone $$K$$, so $$y \in K^*$$. On the right, the halfspace with inward normal $$z$$ does not contain $$K$$, so $$y \notin K^*$$.

## Dual cones examples

Here are some examples of cones and their duals. The first three are **self-dual**, meaning the cone and its dual are the same. The last example shows that the dual of the $$l_\infty$$ cone is the $$l_1$$ cone, and vice versa.

* $K = \mathbb{R}^n_+, K^* = \mathbb{R}^n_+$
* $K = S^n_+, K^* = S^n_+$
* $K = \{(x, t) \mid  \|x\|_2 \le t \}, K^* = \{(x, t)\mid  \|x\|_2 \le t \}$
* $K = \{(x, t) \mid  \| x \|_1 \le t \}, K^* = \{(x, t) \mid  \| x \|_{\infty} \le t \}$

### $$l_2$$ cone is self-dual

The figure below shows that the $$l_2$$ cone is self-dual. That is, for $$x \in K$$ on the boundary, the normal $$-y$$ of the supporting hyperplane at $$x$$ matches the boundary of $$K$$, and $$y$$ is the boundary of the dual cone $$K^*$$, so $$K$$ and $$K^*$$ coincide.

### The dual cone of $$l_\infty$$ cone is $$l_1$$ cone

The figure below shows that the dual cone of the $$l_\infty$$ cone is the $$l_1$$ cone. That is, when $$x \in K$$ is a boundary point, the normal $$-y$$ of the supporting hyperplane at $$x$$ enters the interior of $$K$$ and coincides with the boundary of the $$l_1$$ cone.
