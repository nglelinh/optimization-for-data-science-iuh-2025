--- layout: post title: 18-04 Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) update chapter: '18' order: '5' owner: Hooncheol Shin categories: - - chapter18 lang: en --- The idea of BFGS thise same as DFP. The only difference thisat the roles of B and H are reversed. BFGS is derived by solving the following problem. >Solve >$$ > \begin{align} >& \min_{H^+} \: \: && {\|W^{1/2} (H^+ - H) W^{1/2} \|_F} \\\\ >& \text{subject to } && {H^+ = (H^+)^T} \\\\ >&&& {H^+s = y} \\\\ >& \text{where } && W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \; \times \; n} \text{ is nonsingular and such that } Ws_k = y_k. > \end{align} \\\\ >$$ The derived updating formulas for $$H$$ and $$B$$ are as follows. >$$ > B^+ = B - \frac{Bss^TB}{s^TBs} + \frac{yy^T}{y^Ts} >$$ and >$$ > \begin{align} >H^+ &= H + \frac{(s-Hy)s^T}{y^Ts} + \frac{s(s-Hy)^T}{y^Ts} - \frac{(s-Hy)^Ty}{(y^Ts)^2} ss^T\\\\ > &= \big( I - \frac{sy^T}{y^Ts} \big) H \big( I - \frac{ys^T}{y^Ts} \big) + \frac{ss^T}{y^Ts} > \end{align} >$$ BFGS also, DFP positive definiteness. (if, $$B$$ positive definite $$s^Ty > 0$$ $$B^+$$ positive is definite. ) of BFGS advantage self-correcting property exists is. if, matrix $$H$$ negative of iteration speed Hessian approximation how many step to, to,. DFP wrong Hessian of approximation about, effect, with, to, to, at, usually, of BFGS performance good is [14].
