# Proximal gradient descent and acceleration

This chapter introduces proximal gradient descent and acceleration techniques for optimization problems involving composite functions.

## Overview
- Proximal gradient descent is used for problems where the objective can be split into a differentiable part and a non-differentiable part.
- Acceleration methods, such as Nesterov's acceleration and FISTA, can improve convergence rates.

## Structure
- Section 1: Proximal gradient descent
- Section 2: Convergence analysis
- Section 3: Matrix completion example
- Section 4: Special cases
- Section 5: Acceleration methods

Refer to each section for details and mathematical formulations.
