# Example: FISTA

In this section, we introduce an example of the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), which is an accelerated proximal gradient method.

## FISTA Algorithm
The FISTA algorithm solves problems of the form:
> $$\min_x g(x) + h(x)$$
where $$g$$ is convex and differentiable, and $$h$$ is convex.

The update steps are:
1. Initialize $$x^{(0)} = x^{(-1)}$$, $$t_0 = 1$$.
2. For $$k = 1, 2, ...$$:
   - $$y^{(k)} = x^{(k-1)} + \frac{t_{k-1} - 1}{t_k} (x^{(k-1)} - x^{(k-2)})$$
   - $$x^{(k)} = \text{prox}_{t_k}(y^{(k)} - t_k \nabla g(y^{(k)}))$$
   - $$t_{k+1} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 t_k^2}}{2}$$

## Application to Lasso
FISTA can be applied to Lasso regression, which involves minimizing a least squares loss with an $$L_1$$ regularization term.

FISTA achieves faster convergence compared to standard proximal gradient methods.
