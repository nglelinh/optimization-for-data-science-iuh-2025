Optimization is at the heart of data science. Whether you're training a neural network, minimizing errors in regression models, or efficiently allocating resources in recommendation systems, you're essentially solving problems that involve finding the "best" solution from a vast set of possibilities. But to do this effectively, you need to speak the language of mathematics. We'll revisit key ideas from linear algebra, set theory, and calculus, ensuring you're equipped to handle gradients, matrices, constraints, and uncertainties that arise in optimization tasks.
