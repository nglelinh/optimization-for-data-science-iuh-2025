## Continuity and Uniform Continuity

**Continuity** and **Uniform Continuity** are fundamental concepts that describe the behavior of functions, particularly concerning their "smoothness" or "predictability." While closely related, they capture distinct properties, with uniform continuity being a stronger condition than mere continuity.

### Definition of Continuity

A function $$f: A \to \mathbb{R}$$ is said to be **continuous at a point** $$c \in A$$ if, for every positive real number $$\varepsilon > 0$$, there exists a positive real number $$\delta > 0$$ such that for all $$x \in A$$, if 

$$\lvert x - c \rvert < \delta$$

then 

$$\lvert f(x) - f(c) \rvert < \varepsilon$$ 

Intuitively, it means that for any desired level of precision $$\varepsilon$$ in the output $$f(x)$$, we can find a sufficiently small interval around $$c$$ (of width $$2\delta$$) such that all $$x$$ values within this interval map to $$f(x)$$ values within an $$\varepsilon$$-interval around $$f(c)$$. The crucial aspect here is that the choice of $$\delta$$ generally depends not only on $$\varepsilon$$ but also on the specific point $$c$$.

A function is **continuous on a set** $$A$$ if it is continuous at every point $$c \in A$$.

**Examples of continuous functions** include all polynomials (e.g., $$f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 1$$), trigonometric functions like $$\sin(x)$$ and $$\cos(x)$$, and exponential functions $$e^x$$ on their respective domains. 

### Definition of Uniform Continuity

**Uniform Continuity**, on the other hand, imposes a more stringent condition. A function $$f: A \to \mathbb{R}$$ is said to be **uniformly continuous on a set** $$A$$ if, for every positive real number $$\varepsilon > 0$$, there exists a positive real number $$\delta > 0$$ such that for all $$x, y \in A$$, if 

$$\lvert x - y \rvert < \delta$$

then 

$$\lvert f(x) - f(y) \rvert < \varepsilon$$

The **key distinction** from point-wise continuity lies in the order of quantifiers: for **uniform** continuity, the $$\delta$$ depends *only* on $$\varepsilon$$ and is independent of the specific points $$x$$ and $$y$$ in the domain.

### Definition of Lipschitz Continuity

**Lipschitz Continuity** provides an even more specific and quantitative notion of continuity. A function $$f: A \to \mathbb{R}$$ is said to be **Lipschitz continuous** (or **L-Lipschitz**) on a set $$A$$ if there exists a constant $$L \geq 0$$ such that for all $$x, y \in A$$:

$$\lvert f(x) - f(y) \rvert \leq L \lvert x - y \rvert$$

The smallest such constant $$L$$ is called the **Lipschitz constant** or **Lipschitz modulus** of $$f$$.

**Key Properties of Lipschitz Continuity:**

1. **Bounded Rate of Change**: The Lipschitz condition ensures that the function cannot change faster than a linear rate determined by $$L$$.

2. **Uniform Continuity**: Every Lipschitz continuous function is uniformly continuous (choose $$\delta = \varepsilon/L$$ for $$L > 0$$).

3. **Almost Everywhere Differentiability**: Lipschitz continuous functions are differentiable almost everywhere, and where the derivative exists, $$\lvert f'(x) \rvert \leq L$$.

**Examples:**
- $$f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$$ is 1-Lipschitz on $$\mathbb{R}$$
- $$f(x) = \sin(x)$$ is 1-Lipschitz on $$\mathbb{R}$$ (since $$\lvert \cos(x) \rvert \leq 1$$)
- $$f(x) = x^2$$ is not Lipschitz on $$\mathbb{R}$$ but is Lipschitz on any bounded interval

### Key Differences and Hierarchy

The three types of continuity form a hierarchy of increasingly strong conditions:

**Continuity ⊆ Uniform Continuity ⊆ Lipschitz Continuity**

1. **Point-wise vs Global**: 
   - **Continuity**: Local property (checked at each point)
   - **Uniform Continuity**: Global property of the entire function
   - **Lipschitz Continuity**: Global property with quantitative bounds

2. **Choice of $$\delta$$**: 
   - **Continuity**: $$\delta$$ can depend on both $$\varepsilon$$ and the specific point $$c$$
   - **Uniform Continuity**: $$\delta$$ depends only on $$\varepsilon$$, working for all points simultaneously
   - **Lipschitz Continuity**: $$\delta = \varepsilon/L$$ provides explicit relationship

3. **Rate of Change Control**:
   - **Continuity**: No control over rate of change
   - **Uniform Continuity**: Ensures bounded variation over small intervals
   - **Lipschitz Continuity**: Provides explicit linear bound on rate of change

4. **Strength Relationships**: 
   - Every Lipschitz continuous function is uniformly continuous
   - Every uniformly continuous function is continuous
   - The converses are not generally true

### Detailed Examples and Comparisons

**Example 1: $$f(x) = x^2$$**
- **On $$\mathbb{R}$$**: Continuous but not uniformly continuous (rate of change $$\lvert f'(x) \rvert = 2\lvert x \rvert$$ is unbounded)
- **On $$[0,1]$$**: Continuous, uniformly continuous, and Lipschitz with $$L = 2$$

**Example 2: $$f(x) = \sin(x)$$**
- **On $$\mathbb{R}$$**: Continuous, uniformly continuous, and 1-Lipschitz (since $$\lvert \cos(x) \rvert \leq 1$$)

**Example 3: $$f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$$**
- **On $$\mathbb{R}$$**: Continuous, uniformly continuous, and 1-Lipschitz
- **Note**: Not differentiable at $$x = 0$$, but still Lipschitz

**Example 4: $$f(x) = \sqrt{x}$$**
- **On $$[0,1]$$**: Continuous and uniformly continuous, but not Lipschitz (derivative unbounded near $$x = 0$$)
- **On $$[a,1]$$ for $$a > 0$$**: Lipschitz with $$L = 1/(2\sqrt{a})$$
