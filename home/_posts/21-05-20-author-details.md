## Author Introduction
**김기범** (astroblasterr@gmail.com)<br>

**김정훈** (placidus36@gmail.com)<br>
Currently enrolled in an integrated master's and doctoral program, with a strong interest in the decision-making field of autonomous vehicles. Researching interactive and safe-guaranteed autonomous driving with surrounding vehicles and people, aiming to develop such systems. While studying basic deep learning/reinforcement learning, realized that much of the motivation and proof in these fields are based on optimization, which led to participation in the Convex Optimization project.

**노원종** (wnoh27@naver.com)<br>
Currently working in network system development, with growing interest in machine learning/deep learning technologies being applied in many fields. While studying applicable techniques for networks, joined the Convex Optimization project to better understand the optimization methods used within. Hopes this book will help those seeking a deeper understanding of optimization principles used in machine learning/deep learning.

**박진우** (www.jwpark.co.kr@gmail.com)<br>
Planned the Convex Optimization course at Modu Research Institute's Pulip School and is currently active as a facilitator. Frustrated by the lack of reference materials compared to the importance of optimization in machine learning, proposed the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. Currently researching synthetic face image generation for multiple people and is also interested in game agent learning using reinforcement learning.

**윤성진** (sjyoon@gmail.com)<br>
Has worked in software R&D and product planning for about 22 years, and in the last 5 years has focused on data and middleware software, and modular robot platform product planning. Currently interested in computer vision based on deep learning and researching synthetic face image generation for multiple people. While studying convex optimization at Modu Research Institute's Pulip School, realized the high entry barrier and lack of Korean resources, which led to participation in the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. Hopes this book will help many interested in machine learning to more easily enter the field of optimization.

**이규복** (gyubokl@gmail.com)<br>
Currently a master's student in industrial engineering, interested in natural language processing, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning. While researching machine learning, realized that machine learning and optimization are inseparable, which naturally led to an interest in optimization. Constantly wished for more friendly resources while studying, and thus joined the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. Hopes this book will be a small hope for those who know the importance of optimization but are discouraged by the high entry barrier. [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyuboklee/)]

**한영일** (thinkingtoyihan@gmail.com)<br>
Studied Computer Science and wireless communication, with interests in cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and artificial life. Feels awe at the foot of the mountain of knowledge called optimization, and learns humility before great knowledge. Hopes this book will be a good guide for those who hesitate to climb the mountain of optimization knowledge.

**황혜진** (brillianthhj@gmail.com)<br>
Graduated with a major in mathematics and a master's in data mining, currently working as a developer in computer vision. Joined the Convex Optimization project to delve deeper into the mathematical background that was not easily understood during deep learning studies, and is committed to understanding and applying optimized methodologies in practice.

## Reviewer
**이주희** (juhee1108@gmail.com)<br>
**Current Research Professor at Ewha Womans University Mathematical Sciences Research Institute**<br>
Received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Ewha Womans University. Main research area is cryptography, developing efficient cryptographic technologies for various applications such as IoT and machine learning, and studying the mathematical theories behind them. Became interested in deep learning for cryptography development, and recently lectured on basic mathematics (linear algebra/calculus/optimization/probability and statistics) at Modu Research Institute's Deep Learning College. While organizing the necessary mathematics for machine learning/deep learning, realized that most problems are non-convex optimization problems, but current solutions often involve converting them to convex optimization problems, which led to studying convex optimization and participating in the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. Hopes this book will help many who realize the importance of mathematics.
