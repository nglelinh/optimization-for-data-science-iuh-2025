## Author's Preface

As public attention is focused on machine learning, interest in optimization is also steadily increasing. However, there is a lack of Korean-language resources for beginners, making it difficult for many to overcome the initial barrier. To address this, the Convex Optimization course was established at the Pulip School of Modu Research Institute, and thanks to the goodwill of participants who wanted to share knowledge, this project was started. Through these activities, I hope to contribute to the intellectual growth of the nation and the popularization of convex optimization in Korea.

The overall content of this document refers to the [Carnegie Mellon University lecture materials](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F16/), and the [Stanford University lecture materials](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) were used as supplementary textbooks. It is recommended to study both references with this ebook as the main guide.

## Translator's Preface

With the continuous development of machine learning, various research is being conducted, and there is a growing movement to apply it to real-world problems. However, without a deep understanding of the mathematics underlying machine learning, understanding and application can only be superficial.

Convex Optimization is not only closely related to machine learning, but also encompasses various subfields of mathematics such as linear algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis, making it an attractive discipline for those studying machine learning. However, the content is not easy to handle alone, and the difficulty of the subject itself is quite high, so we gathered people to start the 2021 Convex Optimization Study. This blog is a record of the study and was created to help those who wish to study alone in the future.

The main content of this blog is migrated with the consent of the authors of [Convex Optimization for All](<https://wikidocs.net/book/1896>). The original content is the most well-known Korean resource on convex optimization and is also sufficient in terms of content.

By inheriting the existing WikiDocs content, this blog aims to make it open source. Therefore, anyone can raise issues on the content and directly create pull requests to contribute. Through this, I hope to make a small contribution to the authors' wish for 'the intellectual growth of the nation and the popularization of convex optimization in Korea.'
