**Jeong-Hoon Kim** (placidus36@gmail.com)<br>
Currently enrolled in a combined master's and doctoral program, with a strong interest in decision-making systems for autonomous vehicles. The goal is to develop autonomous vehicles that can interact safely with surrounding vehicles and people while maintaining safety guarantees. While studying basic deep learning and reinforcement learning, I realized that many motivations and proofs in these fields originate from optimization theory, which led me to participate in the convex optimization project.

**Won-Jong Roh** (wnoh27@naver.com)<br>
Currently working in network system development, I have been interested in machine learning and deep learning technologies that are being applied in many fields recently. While studying techniques applicable to networks, I joined the convex optimization project to better understand the optimization techniques used within them. I hope this book will be of great help to those who want to understand the optimization principles used in machine learning and deep learning in more detail.

**Jinwoo Park** (www.jwpark.co.kr@gmail.com)<br>
Planned the convex optimization course at ModuLabs' Full-Leaf School and currently serves as a facilitator for the program. Feeling frustrated by the severe lack of reference materials compared to the importance of optimization in machine learning, I proposed the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. Currently researching synthetic face image generation for multiple people and also have great interest in game agent learning using reinforcement learning.

**Seong-Jin Yoon** (sjyoon@gmail.com)<br>
Have been working in software research and development and product planning for about 22 years, with the last 5 years focused on data and middleware software, and modular robot platform product planning. Currently interested in deep learning-based computer vision and researching synthetic face image generation for multiple people. While studying convex optimization at ModuLabs' Full-Leaf School, I realized that despite the importance of the field, the entry barrier is high and Korean materials are virtually non-existent, which led me to participate in the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. I hope many people interested in machine learning can more easily enter the field of optimization through this book.

**Gyu-Bok Lee** (gyubokl@gmail.com)<br>
Currently enrolled in a master's program in Industrial Engineering with interests in natural language processing, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning. While researching machine learning, I learned that machine learning and optimization have an inseparable relationship, which naturally led to my interest in optimization. However, while studying, I constantly thought it would be nice to have more user-friendly materials, which led me to participate in the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. I hope this book will provide a small ray of hope for those who recognize the importance of optimization and want to challenge themselves but give up due to the high entry barrier.

**Young-Il Han** (thinkingtoyihan@gmail.com)<br>
Studied Computer Science and wireless communications, with interests in cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and artificial life. I feel amazed standing at the foot of the vast mountain of knowledge called optimization, which I started out of curiosity, and I learn humility once again before this great knowledge. I hope this book will serve as a good guide for those who, like me, hesitate to climb the vast mountain of knowledge called optimization.

**Hye-Jin Hwang** (brillianthhj@gmail.com)<br>
Graduated with a mathematics major and a master's degree in data mining, currently working as a developer in the computer vision field. During my deep learning studies, I wanted to delve deeper into the mathematical backgrounds that were not easily understood, which led me to participate in the convex optimization project. I am committed to understanding the studied content deeply and maintaining continuous interest in how optimized methodologies will be used in actual applications.

## Reviewers
**Juhee Lee** (juhee1108@gmail.com)<br>
**Current Research Professor at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Ewha Womans University**<br>
Obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Ewha Womans University. The main research field is cryptography, focusing on the development of efficient cryptographic technologies in various application areas such as IoT and machine learning, as well as the underlying mathematical theories. Became interested in deep learning for developing cryptographic technologies utilizing machine learning/deep learning, and recently taught foundational mathematics (linear algebra/calculus/optimization/probability and statistics) at ModuLabs' Deep Learning College. While organizing the mathematics needed for machine learning/deep learning, I realized that most problems correspond to non-convex optimization problems, but the current solutions might involve converting them to convex optimization problems, which led me to study convex optimization and participate in the 'Convex Optimization for All' project. I hope this book will be helpful to many people who recognize the importance of mathematics.

**Tae-Soo Chung** (tcheong@korea.ac.kr) <br>
**Current Associate Professor, Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University & Associate Dean for Research, College of Engineering**<br>
Currently serving as an Associate Professor in the Department of Industrial and Management Engineering at Korea University, conducting various research using optimization techniques, and recently also working on industry-academia projects related to machine learning. The main specialty is logistics and SCM optimization using Markov decision processes, and studied various optimization theories while preparing for the doctoral qualifying exam in the Optimization track during the doctoral program. Regarding machine learning, participated in the development and filming of [K-MOOC](http://www.kmooc.kr/) courses "Mathematical Fundamentals for Data Science" and "Machine Learning for Data Science." Although lacking in some areas, I joined this project hoping to contribute even a little to optimization-related work.
